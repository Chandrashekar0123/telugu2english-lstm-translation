## 🧠 Problem Statement

Telugu is one of the major languages spoken in India but lacks robust translation tools when compared to high-resource languages like English. The goal of this project is to create a basic Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system that can convert Telugu sentences into English using a deep learning model. This serves as a foundational prototype for building a larger, production-grade translation tool.

## 📚 Dataset

This project uses a **manually created small dataset** of parallel Telugu-English sentences for demonstration purposes. You can easily scale this up using:

- [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/indictrans/)
- [Tatoeba Project](https://tatoeba.org/)
- [OpenSubtitles via OPUS](https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php)

Sample pairs:

| Telugu                             | English                      |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| నేను ఇంగ్లీష్ మాట్లాడగలుగుతాను     | I can speak English           |
| ఈ రోజు చాలా మంచిది                 | Today is very good            |
| మీరు ఎలా ఉన్నారు?                 | How are you?                  |

## 🔍 Procedure

1. Add `<start>` and `<end>` tokens to target (English) sentences
2. Tokenize both Telugu (source) and English (target) sentences
3. Pad sequences to a uniform length
4. Build a Seq2Seq model with LSTM encoder and decoder
5. Train the model using categorical crossentropy
6. Use encoder-decoder inference to translate new Telugu inputs

## 📈 Model Architecture

- Encoder: Embedding → LSTM → Hidden States (h, c)
- Decoder: Embedding → LSTM (initial state = encoder states) → Dense (Softmax)
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
